    <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span><%= image_tag('drop cap i.jpg', class: 'drop-cap') %><h4>n June 2013, I left my job as a chemist at Polytex Inks to pursue web development.
    I heard about App Academy and began studying Ruby to prepare for the application and interview process. Fortunately, I was admitted into the March 2014 class; 
    unfortunately- 2.5 weeks after starting and a terrible fever later- I was asked to withdraw from the program. The blog link in the footer chronicles this experience.
    <br><br>
    &emsp; Afterwards, I was pretty depressed and took time off from studying. I started reading books that I've always wanted to read but felt like I never had time for.
    Some of the ones I'd recommend are in the 'Good Books' section. In the autumn I became hooked on www.codecademy.com, which does an excellent job of teaching lots of 
    different programming languages. Here are all of the materials I've read through:

    &emsp; When I felt I had a solid grasp on Rails, I decided to make this website using Cloud 9 as my development environment. It's been a lot of fun 
    and I'd like to do this as a career. If you are a prospective employer, you can find my email by clicking the email button below. Upon request, I will 
    send out my resume. If you are a family member or friend, please leave a comment in the 'Shout Out' section. Thanks for visiting!
